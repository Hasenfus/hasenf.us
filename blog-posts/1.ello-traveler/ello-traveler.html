            Wild times we live in aren't they? It certainly feels that way. Seeking to find meaning in the chaos. I find that interaction with the world around me is the best way to do so. Such a concept has been born out of my curiosity with learning paradigms, intelligent agents, games, and Jean Paul Sartre.

            Jean Paul Sarte's exploration of existential ontology seems to bring about the most famous concept of 'Existence precedes essence'. In some sense pointing to the idea that humans are not born with predetermined nature, but that derive such meaning through actions and choices.

            It is a rather curious notion that we as an collectibe and singular agent, each have a reward function that dynamically evolves in a non concave way. Concavity with reference to optimization that procedes indefinitely with a monotonous nature. Our lives are peaks and values, our meaning very much relative to the local optima problem of objective function optimization.
